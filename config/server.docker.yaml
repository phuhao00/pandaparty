# Docker-specific configuration. Backend services point to Docker Compose service names.
# Redis configuration for session storage, caching, etc.
redis:
  addr: "redis:6379" # Redis server address and port (used for single node)
  password: ""           # Redis password (if any), also used for Sentinel authenticated connections if needed.
  db: 0                  # Redis database number, also used with Sentinel.
  #
  # For Redis Sentinel setup, ensure 'addr' might be one of the sentinel addresses or a placeholder if sentinel_addrs is exhaustive.
  # Then, uncomment and configure the following:
  # master_name: "mymaster"
  # sentinel_addrs:
  #   - "sentinel1:26379" # Example: replace with actual sentinel addresses
  #   - "sentinel2:26380"
  #   - "sentinel3:26381"
  # # Note: 'password' and 'db' above are still used when connecting to the master via Sentinel.

# MongoDB configuration for persistent data storage.
mongo:
  uri: "mongodb://mongo:27017" # MongoDB connection URI. This is the primary and simplest way.
  # If the URI above is not sufficient, or you prefer a more structured configuration,
  # you can use the fields below. Note that the official Go MongoDB driver gives precedence
  # to the URI if both are fully specified. These options are useful if the URI is minimal
  # (e.g. just "mongodb://mongo") or for clarity.
  #
  # hosts:
  #   - "mongo1:27017"
  #   - "mongo2:27017"
  #   - "mongo3:27017"
  # replica_set: "myReplicaSet"
  # username: "myUser"
  # password: "myPassword" # IMPORTANT: For production, use environment variables or a secrets manager for passwords.
  # auth_source: "admin" # Or the database the user is defined in.
  # connect_timeout_ms: 10000 # Connection timeout in milliseconds.
  # max_pool_size: 100 # Maximum number of connections in the connection pool.
  #
  database: "dafuweng"             # Default database name for the application
  collection: "config"             # Example collection (specific services might use others like 'players', 'friendships', 'payments')

# Consul configuration for service discovery.
consul:
  addr: "consul:8500" # Consul agent address and port.
  # In a clustered environment, this should typically point to a local Consul agent
  # running on the same node as this service. The local agent is then part of the
  # larger Consul cluster and handles routing to Consul servers.
  # Alternatively, for some setups, this could be a load balancer address 
  # in front of multiple Consul servers, or a DNS name resolving to them.

# NSQ configuration for asynchronous messaging.
nsq:
  nsqd_addr: "nsqd:4150"     # NSQD address for producing messages (used if nsqd_addresses or nsqlookupd_http_addresses are not specified or for direct connection)
  #
  # For connecting to a list of NSQDs (e.g., for a producer that doesn't use lookupd):
  # nsqd_addresses:
  #   - "nsqd1:4150"
  #   - "nsqd2:4150"
  #
  # For NSQLookupd connections (primarily for consumers, but can also be used by producers to discover nsqds):
  # nsqlookupd_http_addresses:
  #   - "nsqlookupd1:4161"
  #   - "nsqlookupd2:4161"
  #
  topic: "dafuweng_topic"         # Default NSQ topic (can be overridden by specific producers/consumers)
  channel: "dafuweng_channel"     # Default NSQ channel (can be overridden by specific consumers)

# Server-specific configurations.
server:
  # NOTE: For proper service registration in Docker, individual servers should ideally register their own Docker service name (e.g., "loginserver") 
  # as their address with Consul, not this global 'host' value if it's "localhost". This may require code changes in how each server calls consul.RegisterService.
  host: "localhost"       # Default host for services to register with Consul (e.g., the machine's IP or a resolvable hostname)
  register_self_as_host: true # For Docker: services register their own container name as host
  # port: 8080              # Default main port for services (e.g., loginserver's HTTP port) - Deprecated
  loginserver_http_port: 8081
  gmserver_http_port: 8088
  gatewayserver_tcp_port: 7777
  
  # RPC port configurations for internal microservices.
  # Each service that exposes an RPC interface should have its port defined here.
  servicerpcports:
    gameserver: 50051
    roomserver: 50052     # RPC port for roomserver
    friendserver: 50053   # RPC port for friendserver
    payserver: 50054      # RPC port for payserver
    loginserver: 50055
    gatewayserver: 50056
    gmserver: 50057
    # Add other services like 'matchingserver' and their RPC ports here as they are developed.
